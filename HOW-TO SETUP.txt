OVERVIEW
This is meant to be a quick guide to getting started with all of the tools we use in this repo.  Once you've completed
this guide you should be ready to start contributing.

INSTALLATION
We use a few pieces of software to help out with formatting an responsive design, namely Foundation and SASS.

http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html
Has a full tutorial for the required software, we'll be using Git, Ruby, NodeJS, Bower, and Compass.

-GIT
http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

-RUBY
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

-NODEJS
http://nodejs.org/

-BOWER
Once you have NodeJS you can run the following command to install Bower.
sudo npm install -g bower grunt-cli
Followed by:
gem install foundation

-COMPASS
http://compass-style.org/

CONFIGURATION
Now that we've got everything installed, it's time to configure the project.
You'll want to open up terminal (or cmd) and cd to the project directory (the directory this file is currently in).
Run the command:
compass watch
From this point on any work you do to .scss files will automatically be compiled to the app.css file in the CSS folder.
Everything else is already configured for you in the bower and config files, have fun!

ADDITION NOTES
I currently use IDEA IntelliJ and have a file watcher configured to run instead of using the compass watch command in ruby.
There are other methods that can be used instead to watch files, this is just the generic catch all, just make sure when uploading
your code that the app.css actually caught the changes you made the first time to validate your watcher of choice actually
works and we're good.  The plugin I use is actually called "File Watchers" and I can provide my configuration upon request.
