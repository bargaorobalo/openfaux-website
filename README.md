## Problem

One of the most prevalent issues today is protecting our internet activity from being obtained by outsiders. Defending yourself from being a victim of MITM Attacks, Network Sniffing, Nosy ISPs, Employers, Network Administrators, Systems Administrators, Internet Censorship and Surveillance seems like an impossible, everlasting chain of threats that everyone online faces. OpenFaux solves these problems by utilizing and innovating on some of the most complex internet technologies.  

## Use Case

* John the Journalist is at his local coffee shop and needs to send a very sensitive email over their Wi-Fi network. OpenFaux allows him to send an email over Gmail.com, but to someone sniffing the network it would look as if heâ€™s simply doing a Google search.

## Features

* **Data Obfuscation** - OpenFaux masks your real data with benign data, misleading outsiders looking in.
* **Encryption** - OpenFaux adds an additional layer of security by encrypting over the benign data.
* **Hide IP** - By routing your data through servers of your choice, your IP Address is masked.
* **Simplicity** - No manual configuration. UI has been simplified to one-click.
* **Free** - Free software allows for accessibility and aligns with our mission.
